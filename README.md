# Video State Machine in Vue/TS/XState


This repository has an example of a state machine using [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) which controls a video player in Vue.

The original idea is by [Leigh Halliday](https://github.com/leighhalliday) who makes some fantastic Youtube tutorials and has a video about how to create this in React posted at [https://youtu.be/d8V5vcZOQe4](https://youtu.be/d8V5vcZOQe4).
